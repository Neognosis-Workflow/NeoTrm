# NeoTrm

NeoTrm is a Blender addon which provides support for directly importing BallisticNG's TRM track mesh format. By default TRM meshes are imported as quads, making it possible to make topological selections to help with track scenery creation.

## Installing
* Select a release on the right hand side and download it.
* In Blender navigate to `Edit -> Preferences -> Addons`.
* Click `Install` at the top right, select the downloaded ZIP.

Releases are kept up to date if Blender makes breaking changes. If there isn't a release specifically for a newer version of Blender, it's very likely because the addon works in the latest version.

## Developing
NeoTrm is written in Pycharm Community Edition and contains a build script / run configuration for automatic addon installation, allowing the project to sit separately to a live Blender installation.

### Blender Autocomplete
Download the latest version of [Fake BPY Module](https://github.com/nutti/fake-bpy-module). 

You can use PIP to install this as a package, or download it manually and setup the interpreter paths in Pycharm to include the directory.

### Building
* Run the `build` configuration
* A `build_config.ini` file will be created in the project directory
* Open `build_config.ini` and set `output path` to an absolute path pointing to your Blender's addon folder. If you're using a newer version of Blender, it may be convenient to use script directories.
* Run the `build` configuration again.
* Provided `output path` points to a valid directory that exists, the addons python files will be copied.

### build_config.ini
**`output path`**  : Your Blender addon directory. This is not the path for the addon being copied itself, but the path that all Blender addons are installed into.

**`name`**         : The name of the addon. This is used for the sub-directory name when copying files.

**`archive`**      : Whether to write a ZIP file for addon distribution. This can be provided for people to use the `install` button in Blender's addon manager.
